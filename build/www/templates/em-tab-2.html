        <p><i class="ion-information-circled"></i> Once in a safe place use a mobile phone to call the AA, making sure
          you can describe your location – look out for the new Driver Location Signs which will help us pinpoint your
          location and direction of travel, or there are reference numbers on all telephones and marker posts.</p>

        <p><i class="ion-information-circled"></i> If you have a smart phone you can download the AA App, which uses the
          GPS function on the phone to find your exact location. With the simple touch of an icon both the call and the
          location are transferred to the AA Control Centre.</p>

        <p><i class="ion-information-circled"></i> If you don't have a mobile walk to an emergency telephone on your
          side of the carriageway – never attempt to cross the carriageway. Follow the arrows on the posts at the back
          of the hard shoulder – the phone is free and connects directly to the police/Highways Agency. Give full
          details to the police and tell them if you are a vulnerable motorist, such as a woman travelling alone.</p>
