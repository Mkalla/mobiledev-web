          If you've broken down it can be hard and often dangerous to stop.
          Get your vehicle off the road if possible and warn other traffic by using your hazard warning lights,
          particularly if your vehicle is causing an obstruction.
          Motorway hard shoulders are for emergency use only. You should only stop if it is a real emergency and you
          have no other choice. It's best to try to drive to a safer place off the motorway if you can rather than
          stopping on the hard shoulder.
