        What happens if there are no garages within 10 miles?
      </div>
      <div class="item item-text-wrap">

        If you have Roadside Cover only and we are unable to repair the vehicle within a reasonable time on the
        roadside, or if repairs are unwise, we will give you a tow of up to 10 miles either to a local garage or an
        address of your choice. A longer tow may require a surcharge.
        If you choose our Recovery option in addition to basic Roadside Cover, we shall transport your vehicle to your
        home or a single address anywhere in the United Kingdom, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.

        Do you need my identification when in need of recovery?
      </div>
      <div class="item item-text-wrap">
        You must provide your valid membership card and proof of your identity or two other forms of identity to use our
        service. If these are not available, we may refuse service or make a charge.

        Are lost car keys covered?
      </div>
      <div class="item item-text-wrap">
        Yes, we would attempt to unlock your car. However, if we are unable to open your vehicle for any reason, we will
        arrange for a locksmith to attend where available, but you will be responsible for the costs. If a locksmith is
        not available, we shall arrange for your vehicle to be taken to a nearby garage for assistance but you will have
        to pay for any work carried out on the vehicle. If you have purchased our Key Replace product you will be
        covered for up to Â£1000 in costs for replacement keys and locks if you lose your keys or they are broken.
